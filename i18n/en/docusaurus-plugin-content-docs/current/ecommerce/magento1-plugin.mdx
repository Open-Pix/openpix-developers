</details>

Extract the contents of the .zip file and paste it into the root folder of your Magento1 store. Usually the root store is named `src` which references source. If your store is different, look for the folder that contains other folders like:

- app
- js
- lib
- skin
- var

As in the example below:

![magento1-src-folder](/img/ecommerce/magento1/magento1-src-folder.png)

Finding the folder that contains those mentioned, just do the following:

- Copy the extracted .zip files;
- Paste into this folder

## 2. Configuring Magento1 Plugin

Enter Magento1 Admin -> System > Configuration > Sales (side menu) > Payment Methods

![sales_pay_method.png](/img/ecommerce/magento1/sales_pay_method.png)

Upon accessing `Payment Methods` you will notice the Collapsible `OpenPix - Pix`

![openpix_pay_tab.png](/img/ecommerce/magento1/openpix_pay_tab.png)

- **App ID** Insert AppID or Register a Plugin-type AppID. Create an appID [here](../apis/api-getting-started.md)
- **Webhook Authorization** Create a password for the Webhook integration. Webhook is required to update the status of Orders in real time when the Pix charge is paid.
  - Remember: The URL to be used in the webhook must be: `https://yourstore/openpix/webhook` when you register it on the OpenPix platform
  - Remember: The key you use here must be the same at the time you register it on the OpenPix platform.
  - Create a Webhook [here](#3-create-the-webhook-within-the-platform-openpix).
- **Enabled** Enable/Disable the plugin as a payment method
- **Title** Payment method title in your Magento1 store

### 2.2 Configuring CPF/CNPJ for Customer (optional)

To save the customer's cpf/cnpj of the order in your OpenPix collection you need to activate the `TaxVat` field in your Magento store.

**Note: If you go without the configuration of this field, your charges will be saved without the same customer.**

Enter Magento1 Admin -> System > Configuration > Customers (side menu) > Customer Configuration

![magento1-customer-sidemenu](/img/ecommerce/magento1/magento1-customer-sidemenu.png)

In `Show Tax/VAT Number` select the required value:

![magento1-customer-taxvat](/img/ecommerce/magento1/magento1-customer-taxvat.png)

From now on, customers will have to fill in this field with their CPF or CNPJ and it will be used to save the customer on the OpenPix platform.

### 2.3 Giftback

Important reminder about the [Giftback](../giftback/what-is-giftback.md) feature for magento1. The plugin supports it, but for customers to be covered, only those who use CPF in their purchases will be included in it.

> **The minimum version of the Magento1 plugin to consume the giftback feature is 1.2.5**

## 3. Create the Webhook within the OpenPix Platform

Register the Webhook who will be responsible for updating your Magento1 store when a Pix charge is paid.

To register a new Webhook follow the steps below:

- Go to the OpenPix platform and access: Admin -> Settings -> API/Plugins -> New Webhook
- Use the same password registered in your Magento1 store. Webhook is required to update the status of Orders in real time when the Pix charge is paid.
- The Callback URL that must be used in the registration is found right below the field where the webhook password is registered within your Magento1 store. The default is: `https://yourstore/openpix/webhook`

![Webhook](/img/ecommerce/magento1/magento1-openpix-webhook.png)

## 4. Place Order with Pix

Choose the option to pay the order using Pix

![Pay Pix](/img/ecommerce/magento1/magento1-checkout-cart.png)

Pay Pix using your bank's app.

![Checkout Success](/img/ecommerce/magento1/successPayment.png)

Validate Order status changed after payment

## Updating the plugin
We advise OpenPix customers to always be up to date with the latest version of the plugin. You can identify it in the installation step.

If your plugin is out of date, just follow the steps of the same installation step and update the plugin files in your ecommerce.

## Debug

To debug the OpenPix plugin we have two files and both files you can find on `var/log`:

- `openpix_exception.log`: file that concentrates logs referring to the process of creating a new Magento order and consequently the charge on the OpenPix side
- `openpix_webhooks.log`: file that gathers logs referring to the payment process of an order. The webhook is called when we identify a new Pix in your account and it takes care of updating the order status in your Magento store.
