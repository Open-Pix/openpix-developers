### After adding your appID, click `Configure now with one click` to configure or create your Webhook.

- [ ] When clicking on the fields, `Webhook Authorization` and `Webhook HMAC Secret Key` will automatically update and show the status in `Webhook Status`.

### If you don't configure it, you can access a platform, create a webhook manually. For that:

- [ ] Create a password for the Webhook integration. The Webhook is required to update the status of the Orders in real time when the Pix charge is paid.
- [ ] Register a WooCommerce Callback URL on OpenPix. Example: <https://meusite.com.br/wc-api/WC_OpenPix_Pix_Gateway>
- [ ] Click on `Configure now with one click` again, to configure the Webhook with this new data created.

### 2.2 Client

To save the customer from the order in their OpenPix billing, a plugin must be activated that allows the customer to inform the CPF/CNPJ at the time of purchase.

We recommend using the [woocommerce-extra-checkout-fields-for-brazil](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-extra-checkout-fields-for-brazil/) plugin for this case. Once the plug-in is activated, you will save customers who will inform the CPF/CNPJ at the time of purchase.

**Note: Use is not mandatory. If you proceed without configuring it, your charges will be saved without the same client.**

## 3. Place Order with Pix

Choose the option to pay for the order using Pix

## 4. How to configure Woocommerce order expiration

Openpix billing has a default expiry value of 1 day, while Woocommerce default expiry setting is 60 minutes

To learn more about configuring the OpenPix Charge expiration time [Click here](/docs/flows/flow-edit-default-expiration).

To change and match this expiry time for OpenPix and Woocommerce, you must look in the admin menu:

`Woocommerce` > `Settings` > `Products` > `Inventory`

Lastly, change the Hold stock value to 1440 minutes equivalent to 1 day
